## Minutes/actions from previous meeting

### Updates from related communities

#### PQCA

* A blog post was published two weeks ago from Nvidia on accelerating PQC.
* A blog post is being prepared for the one-year anniversary of PQCA.
  * There will be a section in the blog post on PQCP.
  * A section on "what to expect in 2025" will be included.

#### OQS

* Two big changes were getting ML-KEM-Native into OQS thanks to Bazel and the ML-KEM implementation from CUPQC from Nvidia.
* There have been loose conversations around API changes.
  * The feeling is that preserving the current three-function API is not a priority, and offering flexibility to users is preferred.
* Discussions are underway about whether PQCP should make its own ML-KEM provider.
  * A new issue will be created for discussion.
* An issue was recently opened on liboqs talking about adding checks for ML-KEM keys.
  * The specific check that it mentioned is called pairwise consistency checks.

### Review of subprojects

#### mlkem-native

* API changes are being discussed.
  * The API will be implemented in MLKEM-Native.
  * The NIST discussions did not go any further.
  * The API will be implemented in a backward, compatible way.
  * Additional functions will be added.
  * The NIST issue will be closed.
* The AWS-LC integration is in progress.
  * A draft pull request has been opened.
The OpenSSL CLA issue was discussed.
* The issue is whether to get the contributors to ML-KEM-Native to sign the CLA.
* This means not just the current contributors but also the previous contributors to the reference implementation.
* The feedback from the PQCrystals team was positive, but not everyone has responded yet.
* There are about eight people on the reference implementation.
* It is not very likely that OpenSSL will use the PQCP algorithm.
* The PQCP TSC needs to decide whether it is worth the time to get the CLA signed.
* The issue will be closed if it is not going anywhere.
* The PQCrystals team will be double-checked.
* If they have not signed the CLA, then the issue will be closed.  

#### Open TSC issues

It was noted we should review the backlog in a future meeting

### Any other business

* An offline vote will be held on whether to add Jake Massimo (@jakemas) to the TSC as a voting member.
* Agreed to reschedule future meetings as per notice in Agenda - PQCA Calendar will be updated
